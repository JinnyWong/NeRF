# NeRF Project 
Reconstruct 3D scenes with NeRF and Nerfstudio. 

Project for Fudan University Computer Graphics course, spring 2024. Instructed by Professor [Yan Bo](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/yanbo/en/index.htm).

## Dataset 
We first converted and extracted the video frames into images.

Then, we pre-processed 313 images of the M60 tank with COLMAP (feature extraction, feature matching, sparse reconstruction).

- [COLMAP pre-processed images of the M60 Tank (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jinnywjy/tanks-and-temple-m60-colmap-preprocessed/data)

## Models
We trained and used Nerfstudio's Nerfacto and Splatfacto model. Training was done on Kaggle using the P100 GPU.

## Model performance
PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) is a measure of the peak error between the rendered image and the ground truth image, and it is expressed in decibels (dB). A higher PSNR value indicates better image quality and a closer match to the ground truth image.
| Dataset  | Model | PSNR |
|---|---|---|
| M60 Tank | Nerfacto  | 19.25  |
| M60 Tank  | Splatfacto  | 27.46  |

## Extras 
For the extra part of our project, we've decided to build a 3D model and animation of Professor Yan Bo from a 2D image. 

The 3D model was built with DreamGaussian, and the animations were done with Mixamo.
